She has worked on farms and in community gardens, teaching garden education and community nutrition.

She loves the connections Good Eggs is growing between local foodmakers and food eaters! There’s nothing more beautiful than community bonds!

As a child of parents from New Orleans, Claudia has been surrounded by food and cooking from a very early age. She has always believed that the best foods are the ones prepared by hand and naturally, and is am thrilled to help make it easier for others to enjoy delicious local eating. Good Eggs truly has unlimited potential, because the concept can be applied anywhere!

#### Joyce Ding (Data Analyst, Good Eggs)
Joyce spent a lot of time between ages three to six on her great-grandma’s farm in China. It was a farm with many kinds of crops and animals. She raised her own pet chickens and helped her uncle tend cows. That was the time when her affection for nature, animals, farmers, and local communities first started. Now she’s happily working at a company that strives to nurture all of these things that she deeply cares about.

#### Aley Hanson (Designer, Good Eggs)
Aley is a San Francisco native, eternal optimist, and mother nature’s biggest fan. She is blessed to support local food in the best way she knows how: through visual design. When she is not designing for Good Eggs’ awe-inspiring farmers and foodmakers, you’ll find her in a tree, practicing the art of smiling for no reason.

#### Jillian Becerra (Ops Manager, Good Eggs)
“All sorrows are less with bread.” This quote from Miguel de Cervantes perfectly captures the importance of both great literature and delicious food in Jilian’s life. Therefore, it’s no surprise that Jillian immediately found intrinsic beauty in the simplicity of a process that supplies people with nourishing, local food. Unfortunately, the benefits of local food have been restricted to those who have access to these markets and have the financial means to enter them. It’s her dream to begin bridging this gap through a combination of equitable access, awareness and availability across all communities.
