The first [Cultivate meetup](http://www.meetup.com/cultivate) was a huge success.

Over 80 members of the developer community came together on a chilly San Francisco night, under a common purpose: to use technology for the betterment of humanity and the planet.

As Good Eggs CTO Alon Salant said in an opening statement, "We are building tools that affect real people in the real world. It's about affecting real change in someone's work to enhance their life."

The event kicked off with with a delicious bang: [Love & Hummus](https://www.goodeggs.com/loveandhummus) delivered an exceptional dining experience. Hearty falafel wraps, homemade tahini sauce, spicy hummus, sultry baklava, and mint-garnish lemonade.

If your mouth isn't watering yet, wait till you sink your teeth into the presentations.

Hanging up on Callbacks - [More than] Flow Control w/ECMAScript 6 Generators
---

[Erin Swanson-Healey](http://www.carbonfive.com/employee/erin-swenson-healey) from Carbon Five gave a thorough walk-through into dealing with asynchronous callbacks in Javascript. With charisma and charm he  stated that we have new ways to deal with "callback hell".

New Solution: [ECMAScript 6](http://www.2ality.com/2013/06/iterators-generators.html) provides generators, which alleviates some of challenges that are associated with asynchronous callbacks.

Read Erin's [detailed blog post](http://blog.carbonfive.com/2013/12/01/hanging-up-on-callbacks-generators-in-ecmascript-6/) on the topic, and check out his [slides](https://docs.google.com/a/goodeggs.com/presentation/d/1c23KjxQIoKKjho2wnjRXdJhmWd6X3g10B5ggC1DUE0M/edit#slide=id.p) from the presentation here.

Whats new in Node v0.12.

Next up was [Bert Belder](https://github.com/piscisaureus) from StrongLoop. Bert is one of the principal authors of [libuv](http://nikhilm.github.io/uvbook/introduction.html), which is the library on which Node.js is built. Needless to say, we were stoked to see him present at the first Cultivate meetup!

Bert provided insight into:

* Round-robin clustering
* Profiling
* ExecSync
* Multi-context

MongoDB Performance Fundamentals for Web Apps
---

[Adam Hull](https://www.goodeggs.com/about/team/sfbay/522103184f08c30300000028) from Good Eggs was our final presenter, and he finished strong! We were lucky to have insights from Adam into performance, speed, and use of Mongo. The presentation ended with a pretty long Q&A session that surfaced  answers to some questions that the collective developer community seemed to have been yearning to ask. Many of the remarks were confirmed with a head-nod from two developers from MongoLab in the audience. Head nods and "ah ha's" all around!

Lightning Talks
---

Flashing through in 5-minute intervals, our speedy speakers were able to capture the audience with cool projects and insights, including:

* Jessica Lam - [real-time collaboration with sugarbox.io](http://www.sgrbx.io/#/play/sHMVrO1jg8)
* Max Edmands - [lazy.js](http://danieltao.com/lazy.js/) + [slides](https://github.com/demands/lazy-presentation)
* Stewart Noyce - [lessons learned](http://www.trunort.com/docs/Cultivate-Dec2013.pdf)
* Shubhra Kar - [StrongOps Node performance monitoring dashboard](http://strongloop.com/strongloop-suite/strongops/)
* Alon Salant, - [fibrous library](https://github.com/goodeggs/fibrous)

Overall, from our speakers there is one common thread: writing great apps with JavaScript is hard work. But with new tools, techniques and frameworks emerging, we can "cultivate" the developer community into a unified force, working together to blend technology and awareness to benefit humankind, the planet, and our future.

Join us for our next event, happening in early 2014!
