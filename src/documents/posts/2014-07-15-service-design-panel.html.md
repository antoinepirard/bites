Recent years have seen the rise of companies that serve well-established needs in peopleâ€™s lives with novel supply chains built on the resources and hard work of individuals rather than faceless corporations.

AirBnB provides travel accommodation by aggregating rooms, apartments and houses from individuals around the world. Good Eggs provides home groceries by aggregating food available directly from local farmers and foodmakers. Lyft provides daily transportation by connecting passengers to people with cars and spare time.

Travel accommodation, groceries and transportation are age-old needs. These companies are serving them in new ways with hybrid online/offline services that build on the ubiquity of internet technology to organize complex supply systems into simple-to-use services for their customers.

How do you design and deploy a brand across digital and physical experiences? How do you provide a consistent customer experience when much of the product experience is provided by a third party?

Join us for a conversation on the challenges, learnings and opportunities in designing for these kinds of services.

This event is a panel discussion with leaders in design from AirBnb, Good Eggs and Lyft.

Andrew Schapiro, _Design Lead, AirBnB_<br/>
Robin Bigio, _Creative Director, Good Eggs_<br/>
Frank Yoo, _Director of Product Design, Lyft_<br/>

Doors open at 6:30pm for great nourishing local snacks and drink from Good Eggs producers. Panel discussion starts at 7:30pm. Doors close at 9:30pm.
