Last Wednesday, Aug 6, we hosted [A Conversation Service Design with Airbnb, Good Eggs and Lyft](/posts/service-design-panel/). Here's the video of that conversation for those who were unable to join us in person.

Thanks to Patrice Martin from IDEO.org for her skillful moderating and to Katie Dill from Airbnb, Robin Bigio from Good Eggs and Frank Yoo from Lyft for their great insights. Thanks also to those who shared [photos and thoughts with #cultivatedesign](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cultivatedesign).

## What I learned

One concept in particular stood out for me. It was the idea that you can't actually design all touch points of the customer experience across a service that spans the physical and digital realms and where much of the actual service is provided by a third party. Rather, identify and nurture a set of core values across all members of your team, your customers and your service providers and allow them to manifest those values in ways that are natural to them. Through this you will find behaviors emerging out in the wild that are consistent with those core values and result in a remarkably consistent experience for all involved.

For Airbnb a core value is that the host is the hero of the guest experience. For Good Eggs it is the mission to grow and sustain local food systems worldwide. For Lyft it is a quirky style that celebrates individualism.

What did you learn?
