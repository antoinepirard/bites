I am 32 and Good Eggs is the first company I have ever drawn a salary from. It was never my intention--I dreamed of working at Alias|Wavefront or Pixar when I was a kid. But the most exciting opportunties I had were always hourly gigs, contracting jobs, grad school, or most recently: founding a startup.

Carried by the abrosia of Paul Graham's essays, and the earnest belief that if I could build a web app I could build a company, I just tried to do it. I made paper prototypes, did usability testing, did some agile planning and test-driven-development, put out an MVP garden seed subscription, and started filling orders.

And there went five years of my life.

It turns out, starting a company is hard. And it didn't really work on the first try, or the fifth try. All those years of lone-wolf book report writing in my childhood had given me the belief that I could single-handedly achieve ANYTHING!

But in reality there are a bunch of management skills that I'm not that good at yet. I have a hard time saying no to fun important ideas that don't need to happen yet. Especially when I'm supposed to be saying no to myself. And I'm not that good at the clockwork check-ins and expectation setting that help employees make steady progress towards a common goal.

I just started month three of my employment here at Good Eggs and I think it was the right decision. My mental health has drastically improved since backburning my startup business. Being able to focus on continuous improving without having to sweat about existential threats to the business has been a huge relief.

And being able to trust that my team is smart and does great stuff in my absence is *awesome*. And it's wonderful to be able to learn from some founders who seem to know what they're doing. Everyone here seems pretty happy about their jobs. Folks mostly go home at a reasonable hour and we get a ton of stuff done. So, something's working. And it's a relief to be able to spend some time understanding how a ship sails without having to tie yourself to the wheel every time a storm comes.

Which isn't to say I'm not still dreaming about founding an anarcho-syndicalist radically inclusive post-corporation. I've just realized it takes a village and I won't get there if I spend my time alone in the woods.
