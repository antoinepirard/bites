We're partnering with [JSFest](http://jsfest.com) to host a JavaScript hack night for social good on Sunday evening March 9. JSFest runs March 6-12 in San Francisco.

Let's spend a few hours hacking together to make the world a better place. Bring your project or your desire to help others with theirs. Open source and socially-minded projects are all welcome. If you want to give a short presentation or run a mini workshop we have the facilities and welcome your initiative.

We'll kick off with project intros and requests for help to connect hackers with the projects they are interested in.

Start at 6pm with some great local food and drink to help us all connect, kick off at 6:30pm and doors close at 10:00pm.
A few folks from Good Eggs with expertise in Node, Backbone, Angular, MongoDB and more will be around to help and with some projects of their own.

[Reserve your spot](http://www.meetup.com/cultivate/events/167399892/) and we'll see you Sunday!
