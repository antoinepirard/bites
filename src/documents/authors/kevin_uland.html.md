My personal food story began with my first ever part time job: working as a produce associate in a local grocery store for 2 years during high school. Evaluating the breadth of fruits and veggies and delivering great customer service became the foundation of my working life! To be part of a company that is focused on solving large world sustainability issues by creating new opportunities to connect local farmers and customers deeply resonates with me. I feel a personal connection to the end product because it is very visible and has direct tangible benefits to overall human health. The globalization of the company and the product is something I am very excited to see play out in coming times - there are exciting developments happening every week! Outside of improving local food systems, you can find me surfing with mother ocean, pickin' n' strummin' on my guitar, or jamming along at a music festival - "pura vida!"
