I think the Internet is the greatest achievement of mankind, and I get excited when the power and reach of the digital world can create and reinforce real world interactions. By growing and sustaining local food systems, Good Eggs is building local communities, and I’m thrilled to be a part of it! As we grow, more and more people will be able to connect with their local farmers and producers. Better tasting, fresher, healthy food with no waste plus stronger local economies: a win-win! When I can get away, I love to tour countries by bicycle. I’ve found no better speed to fully experience a place but still cover ground. Plus you work up quite an appetite!
