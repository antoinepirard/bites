bio1: I think the Internet is the greatest achievement of mankind, and I get excited when the power and reach of the digital world can create and reinforce real world interactions. By growing and sustaining local food systems, Good Eggs is building local communities, and I’m thrilled to be a part of it! As we grow, more and more people will be able to connect with their local farmers and producers. Better tasting, fresher, healthy food with no waste plus stronger local economies: a win-win! When I can get away, I love to tour countries by bicycle. I’ve found no better speed to fully experience a place but still cover ground. Plus you work up quite an appetite!

bio2: People working with food because they want to are unusually nice. I like spending time with them. So I make software for Good Eggs. Some day I'll step away from the screen long enough to build a mixed residential & commercial multi-tenant owner-occupied urban building. The ground floor will have a café with pastries and coffee sourced from Good Eggs. The veggies will come from a combo treehouse / farm / summer home not too many miles away. Until then, I'll climb rocks.
