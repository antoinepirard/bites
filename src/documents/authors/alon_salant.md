Food for me is about connection - connection to friends and family through meals prepared and eaten at home, connection to the earth through growing vegetables in my garden, connection to the changing seasons through the diversity of products available throughout the year, and connection to my community by being a patron of the amazing growers and producers in the Bay Area. These connections are a source of great pleasure and meaning in my life and are what I hope to share with the world through Good Eggs.
