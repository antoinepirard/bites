We started Good Eggs because we wanted to help farmers and foodmakers. Years later, that spirit of service is still at the core of our culture. I feel lucky every day that I get to use my technology chops to help grow local food systems. When I'm not opening pull requests, you're most likely to find me pushing a swing or relaxing on a picnic blanket with my wife and daughter.
