Come for the food, stay for the technology. Good Eggs isn't a bunch of hippies going around hugging trees or something. We know that in order to make an impact you have to take action; disrupt the industry. I look forward to the day when the ultra local model is ubiquitous across all sorts of industries to empower makers everywhere rather than restrain them with antiquated laws. When I'm not punching faces to make the world a better place, you can find me at the local coffee shop enjoying electro-dubtech under my headphones or enjoying the countryside from my bike. From Russia, with love. Viva la revoluci√≥n.
