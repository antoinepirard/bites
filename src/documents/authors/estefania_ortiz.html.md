I was born and raised in Puerto Rico. I came to the valley because of my passion for Software and discovered my interest in Social Entrepreneurship. I am interning at Good Eggs because I am fascinated by the way technology can empower people to solve real problems, and what a better problem to solve than our disconnect to food?
