People working with food because they want to are unusually nice. I like spending time with them. So I make software for Good Eggs. Some day I'll step away from the screen long enough to build a mixed residential & commercial multi-tenant owner-occupied urban building. The ground floor will have a caf√© with pastries and coffee sourced from Good Eggs. The veggies will come from a combo treehouse / farm / summer home not too many miles away. Until then, I'll climb rocks.
