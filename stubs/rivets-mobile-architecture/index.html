<p>Before coding a phone-shaped farmer&#39;s market, the GoodEggs team built
production sites using tools at both extremes of the javascript application
ecosystem. We built the desktop experience on the minimal
<a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>. Backbone&#39;s extensive use of <code>get()</code> and
<code>set()</code> always bothered us a little. It made sharing code between the browser
and node.js server harder. At the other extreme,
<a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>&#39;s declarative data binding let us crank out
internal tools with lots of moving pieces. Unfortunately, the <em>rest</em> of
Angular, another 100k of strong opinions, was too much for the zippy mobile
site we envisioned. The brilliant Dr. Zoller pointed the team at
<a href="http://www.rivetsjs.com/">Rivets</a>, which turned out to be just the right
size. Its simple hooks for server-side pre-rendering, Angular inspired
declarative binding, and small pageweight helped us get commits in fast and
deliver tiny snacks to pocket-sized screens at speeds approaching our sub-
second dreams.
