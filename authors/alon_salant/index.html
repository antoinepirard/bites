<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>
<p>One concept in particular stood out for me. It was the idea that you can&#39;t actually design all touch points of the customer experience across a service that spans the physical and digital realms and where much of the actual service is provided by a third party. Rather, identify and nurture a set of core values across all members of your team, your customers and your service providers and allow them to manifest those values in ways that are natural to them. Through this you will find behaviors emerging out in the wild that are consistent with those core values and result in a remarkably consistent experience for all involved.</p>
<p>For Airbnb a core value is that the host is the hero of the guest experience. For Good Eggs it is the mission to grow and sustain local food systems worldwide. For Lyft it is a quirky style that celebrates individualism.</p>
<p>What did you learn?</p>

<p>Recent years have seen the rise of companies that serve well-established needs in people’s lives with novel supply chains built on the resources and hard work of individuals rather than faceless corporations.</p>
<p>Airbnb provides travel accommodation by aggregating rooms, apartments and houses from individuals around the world. Good Eggs provides home groceries by aggregating food available directly from local farmers and foodmakers. Lyft provides daily transportation by connecting passengers to people with cars and spare time.</p>
<p>Travel accommodation, groceries and transportation are age-old needs. These companies are serving them in new ways with hybrid online/offline services that build on the ubiquity of internet technology to organize complex supply systems into simple-to-use services for their customers.</p>
<p>How do you design and deploy a brand across digital and physical experiences? How do you provide a consistent customer experience when much of the product experience is provided by a third party?</p>
<p>Join us for a conversation on the challenges, learnings and opportunities in designing for these kinds of services.</p>
<p>This event is a panel discussion with leaders in design from Airbnb, Good Eggs and Lyft.</p>
<p>Katie Dill, <em>Experience Design Lead, Airbnb</em><br/>
Robin Bigio, <em>Creative Director, Good Eggs</em><br/>
Frank Yoo, <em>Director of Product Design, Lyft</em><br/></p>
<p>Moderated by Patrice Martin, <em>Co-Lead + Creative Director, IDEO.org</em></p>
<p>Doors open at 6:30pm for great nourishing local snacks and drink from Good Eggs producers. Panel discussion starts at 7:30pm. Doors close at 9:30pm.</p>

Have you written them down?</p>
<p>Lots of people think they have clear criteria for hiring but have never taken the time to write them down. Written criteria are an important component of an effective hiring process. In this post I&#39;ll share some guidance on establishing clear criteria, how to use them to design an efficient interview process, and the role they play in developing diversity on your team.</p>
<h2 id="defining-your-hiring-criteria">Defining Your Hiring Criteria</h2>
<p>There are a number strategies you can use to get to your criteria. If you haven&#39;t already you could probably just write them down right now and have something to work with. That&#39;s a fine start. Sharing them with your team for review and revision is likely to make them even better.</p>
<p>Another approach is to actively engage your team in developing your criteria. You can get pretty far with this short exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather your team in a quiet room</li>
<li>Hand out stickies and sharpies</li>
<li>Give the team 3 minutes to write down the desirable attributes of members of your team, one attribute per sticky</li>
<li>Have each person put their stickies on a wall and form clusters of related items</li>
<li>Give every member of the team 4 votes to <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DotVoting.html">dot vote</a> their top attributes</li>
</ul>
<p>Do the items with the most votes look like your criteria? You hopefully have a mix of different criteria that cover technical skills, working style, personality traits, domain expertise and more.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s spend a few hours hacking together to make the world a better place. Bring your project or your desire to help others with theirs. Open source and socially-minded projects are all welcome. If you want to give a short presentation or run a mini workshop we have the facilities and welcome your initiative.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll kick off with project intros and requests for help to connect hackers with the projects they are interested in.</p>
<p>Start at 6pm with some great local food and drink to help us all connect, kick off at 6:30pm and doors close at 10:00pm.
A few folks from Good Eggs with expertise in Node, Backbone, Angular, MongoDB and more will be around to help and with some projects of their own.</p>

When you write a module, what options do you have for designing its interface?</p>
<p>When I was first learning to work in Node I found the sheer number of ways to do things to be a bit overwhelming. JavaScript is extremely flexible and the community of developers contributing to open source seem to have different styles for implementing the same thing.</p>
<p>On my journey with Node I&#39;ve been keeping an eye out the Good Way to do things and adopting them for use in my own work and in our work at Good Eggs.</p>
<p>In this post I&#39;ll share my observations of the Node module system and the ways in which you can use it to encapsulate and share code. My goal is to identify and illustrate useful patterns for module interface design and to help you understand when and how to use them in your own work.</p>
<p>I discuss seven patterns below, many of which can be used in combination. They are:</p>
