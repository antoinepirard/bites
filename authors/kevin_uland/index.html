Evaluating the breadth of fruits and veggies and delivering great customer service became the foundation of my working life! To be part of a company that is focused on solving large world sustainability issues by creating new opportunities to connect local farmers and customers deeply resonates with me. I feel a personal connection to the end product because it is very visible and has direct tangible benefits to overall human health. The globalization of the company and the product is something I am very excited to see play out in coming times - there are exciting developments happening every week! Outside of improving local food systems, you can find me surfing with mother ocean, pickin&#39; n&#39; strummin&#39; on my guitar, or jamming along at a music festival - &quot;pura vida!&quot;</p>

&quot;great first event for a meetup with a compelling mix of javascript code and social impact&quot;

&quot;Great meetup! Lots of interesting people and talks. Looking forward to future ones.&quot;

<blockquote>
&quot;This was a great way to kickoff the Cultivate meetups; I left informed, enthused, (oh yeah, and nourished) and committed to return.&quot;
