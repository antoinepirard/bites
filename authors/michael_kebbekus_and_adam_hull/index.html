By growing and sustaining local food systems, Good Eggs is building local communities, and I’m thrilled to be a part of it! As we grow, more and more people will be able to connect with their local farmers and producers. Better tasting, fresher, healthy food with no waste plus stronger local economies: a win-win! When I can get away, I love to tour countries by bicycle. I’ve found no better speed to fully experience a place but still cover ground. Plus you work up quite an appetite!<div class="author">- Michael</div></div></div><div class="coauthor"><div class="meta"><img src="http://fpio.goodeggs.com/api/file/ziGF1yRt2PAZq3BpMQAA/convert?w=150&amp;h=150&amp;fit=crop&amp;align=faces&amp;cache=true" /></div><div class="content">People working with food because they want to are unusually nice. I like spending time with them. So I make software for Good Eggs. Some day I'll step away from the screen long enough to build a mixed residential & commercial multi-tenant owner-occupied urban building. The ground floor will have a café with pastries and coffee sourced from Good Eggs. The veggies will come from a combo treehouse / farm / summer home not too many miles away. Until then, I'll climb rocks.<div class="author">- Adam</div></div></div></section></div><div class="blog-index"><article><header><h1 class="entry-title"><a href="../../posts/good-eggs-goes-mobile/">Good Eggs Goes Mobile</a></h1><p class="meta"><a href="../../authors/michael_kebbekus_and_adam_hull/">Michael Kebbekus and Adam Hull</a> on <time datetime="2014-04-11T00:00:00.000Z">April 11th, 2014</time></p></header><div class="entry-content"><p>In the past 6 months, 25% of our traffic came from mobile devices, and those users faced a
daunting, near impossible shopping experience. In response, we launched a new
mobile version of <a href="http://goodeggs.com">goodeggs.com</a> two weeks ago with an
eye to simplify our major use case of filling your basket with products and
checking out. To create the mobile experience we considered three options:</p>
<ol>
<li>native mobile apps for iOS and Android</li>
<li>a responsive re-design of our existing website</li>
<li>building a mobile website from scratch</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="native-someday">Native Someday</h3>
<p>While native mobile apps offer the potential for a superior user experience, our
first priority was handling the 25% of traffic already coming to our website.
Even with a nagging banner to download a native app, we&#39;d still have users
visiting our site on mobile devices. Additionally, we wanted to be able to
iterate quickly on the mobile platform and not be at the whim of the App Store&#39;s
approval process nor users&#39; responsibilities to install updates.</p>
<h3 id="not-responsive-enough">Not Responsive Enough</h3>
<p>We also ruled out a responsive design pretty quickly. Our requirements for the
mobile application were to deliver a fast and simple experience. With such small
screen real estate on the phone, we knew we wanted to completely rethink the
layouts and content of our pages; a little too complex for fluid grids, and
media queries.</p>
<h3 id="fresh-start">Fresh Start</h3>
<p>Instead of continuing with our &quot;desktop&quot; stack built on
<a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>, we decided to take the opportunity for a fresh start. 
With <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>,
<a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>, <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a>, and other client
side frameworks, the user has to wait for the JavaScript to be loaded before any
client side rendering can begin, and we really wanted to prioritize initial page load. 
We decided for our use cases, we could deliver a better experience by generating HTML on the server side so the phone
can begin rendering as soon as it starts receiving data from the initial request.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, we&#39;ll be taking a deeper dive on some of the major
architectural decisions we made. Check back to learn about:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Rivets instead of Backbone/Angular/etc.</strong><br><a href="http://www.rivetsjs.com/">Rivets</a>, turned out to be just the right size for this project.  Its simple hooks for server-side pre-rendering, Angular inspired declarative binding, and small pageweight helped us get commits in fast and deliver tiny snacks to pocket-sized screens at speeds approaching our sub-second dreams.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Planning page load sequence for faster initial page load</strong><br>To get food on the screen quickly, we considered each step of the page load cycle: the first packet through user-specific javascript execution.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>HTTP Caching with <a href="https://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a></strong><br>Especially with server-side generated HTML, we knew HTTP caching would be our best bet for fast page loads. By normalizing our request headers, separating session information into separate AJAX calls, and setting appropriate cache headers, we achieved significant performance gains.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Appropriate image sizes with <a href="http://www.imgix.com/">imgix</a></strong><br>Folks really seem to <em>get</em> GoodEggs when they can see the food.  The photos are very very very important.  Modern iPhones have dense displays that demand high quality photos, but their networks are often strained.  We&#39;ve found a balance.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Integration testing over unit testing</strong><br>We skipped adding unit tests on browser and express controller code in all but the most critical cases, minimizing the overhead of making sweeping changes, which we made frequently while figuring out our new Rivets-based architecture. Browser based integration tests assured us that shoppers could still experience their journeys after our changes. They were a huge help and a small burden.</p>
</li>
</ul>
