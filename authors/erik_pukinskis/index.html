California wins at food, and I love the wild thinking here, but I miss the snow and the trees from back home. I like chickens, bikes, feminism, decadent vegan food, and toolmaking. I&#39;ve been coding for Good Eggs since April 2014.</p>

That wasn&#39;t exactly my intention. As a teenager I sketched out user interfaces in my room and dreamed of working at Pixar or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000510065138/http://www.aliaswavefront.com/pages/home/index.html">Alias|Wavefront</a>. But I guess my most exciting opportunties were always hourly gigs, contracting jobs, grad school, and&mdash;most recently&mdash;founding a startup.</p>
<p>Self employment has a particular allure. I like design and development because they are super creative, but I can&#39;t resist applying that creativity to management philosophies, corporate structures, and every other aspect of a business. That can make it hard to work for other people, who will inevitably have different ideas about how things should work.</p>
<p>Founding a startup is an alluring alternative. There&#39;s no technical debt to work around. There are no power structures you have to reckon with. You can call shots all day without worrying much about stepping on other peoples&#39; toes. You make compromises and code up ugly hacks, but they&#39;re <em>your</em> compromises and <em>your</em> ugly hacks.</p>
<p>It&#39;s addictive.</p>
<p>And if you can code, you can do a little consulting on the side and support your entrepreneurship habit more or less indefinitely, designing, coding, releasing, and experimenting to your heart&#39;s content.</p>
<p>But a company is more than code. And growing a group of people into a healthy, stable team is hard. In five years of trying on my own, I wasn&#39;t able to get there. All of that freedom allowed me to indulge my whims, but most of those whims turned out to be dead ends. And each time something fell apart, it took a little more of wind out of my sails, both as a boss and as a person. Without anyone else to blame failures on, it got hard to believe in myself. And it got hard to put the work aside in the evening. Even though I was living the entrepreneurship dream, I started waking up with a belly full of dread.</p>
<p>So I reached out to Good Eggs and I got a &quot;real&quot; job. I get in by 10, and I leave by 6. Someone else decides what we eat for lunch. Someone else worries about our brand. Someone else worries about funding. Someone else worries about almost everything.</p>
<p>And I get to choose one or two things each week to really focus on. I&#39;m thinking about the diversity of our engineering team. I&#39;m thinking about doing more rapid prototyping. The team seems to think agile planning and continuous integration make it less neccessary, but I&#39;m not sure.</p>
<p>And I have to say, my mental health is much improved.</p>
<p>So for now, I&#39;m rather enjoying being a corporate done. I still dream of radical departures from the status quo, even here at Good Eggs, where we do a lot of things differently. But these days I have much less desire to white-knuckle things into existence all by myself. It takes a village, and going forward I&#39;m going to try to stay a part of one.</p>
