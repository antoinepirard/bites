This summer I am working as a Software Engineering Intern at Good Eggs. A typical conversation when meeting or running into other interns in the area usually goes something like this: </p>
<p>-Hey! What are you doing this summer? <br>
-Interning at Good Eggs, working on the Shopping Team. <br>
-Cool, what are you working on? <br>
-I&#39;m doing full stack web dev. <br>
-Yeah, but what’s your project? <br>
-Emm, the website...<br></p>
<p>Given that a lot of interns have an intern project, this conversation can be a little awkward sometimes. Questions like How do you get evaluated? and How do you know what to do? often come up, and to be completely honest I have been looking for answers to these questions myself during the summer. </p>
<p>So far this is what I&#39;ve got...</p>

<h3>How do you know what to do?</h3>

<p>Given that I don&#39;t have a pre-defined intern project, my workflow is similar to that of the rest of the engineers at the company. Every day I come into the office and work on the next thing that has to get done. I am getting exposure to the <a href='http://agilemethodology.org/'>Agile </a> and <a href='http://xprogramming.com/what-is-extreme-programming/'>XP</a> processes used at Good Eggs to determine what that next thing is, and I get to see how things go from ideas to shipped code. This experience has taught me a lot in terms of prioritizing, estimating, and planning work.</p>
<h3>How do you get evaluated?</h3>

<p>There are many ways for me to get feedback at Good Eggs. First of all, I have a mentor who meets with me almost every week to talk about how the internship is going, and more broadly about engineering as a career. I have weekly 1:1&#39;s with members of my team to get direct feedback on my work. <a href='http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html'>Pairing</a> and <a href='http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/pullrequest'>Pull Requests </a>help me grow by giving me new perspectives on my code and how to get things done. And if that wasn&#39;t enough, at any given point it is totally cool for me to ask questions like How am I doing?, How was pairing with me today?, or Can you take a look at my code?</p>
<h3>What else do I like about Good Eggs?</h3>

<p><b>Onboarding:</b>
The first week of my internship was full of sessions. We covered <a href='https://github.com/goodeggs/fibrous'>fibrous</a>, front end frameworks, <a href='http://nodejs.org/'> Node.js</a> + <a href='http://expressjs.com/'>Express</a>, Agile and Extreme Programming, test driven development, overviews of the codebase and architecture, and setting up our development environments. This was a lot of material, and I am still learning about all of these things, but that week gave us the language to ask the right questions, and look up what we needed to know.</p>
<p><b>Pairing:</b>
We do a lot of pairing here. This means that I spend my time either coding on my own, coding with someone else, or watching another engineer do some coding. Switching between these three modes of learning has enabled me to learn really fast. I have been fortunate enough to pair with most people on the team, and in a very short amount of time I have seen the workflows, styles, thought processes, and concerns of an entire team of experienced engineers. This is as confusing as it is instructive. There are definitely a lot of ways of doing things, but getting exposure to so many different styles working together has been an incredible learning experience for me. </p>
<p><b>Agency:</b>
In a lot of ways I have been treated as being a member of the team rather than as just an intern in the team. I feel ownership of my work and I have a voice in what I want to work on, what parts of the process I want to be a part of, and what I want to learn. For example, seeing how planning work affects engineering productivity so much, I was interested in learning more about it. I mentioned this to Joe (our Tech Lead) and next thing I knew he gave me an opportunity to get exposed to this part of the process. For our Email Hackathon (a day we just worked on improving the emails sent out to customers) I had the opportunity to organize the project on <a href='https://www.pivotaltracker.com'>Pivotal</a> and actively participate in the process of prioritizing, estimating, and scoping the work for that day. It was a great learning experience and a lot of fun.</p>
<p><b>Diversity:</b>
We are all aware that there is a huge lack of diversity in tech, and as someone who cares deeply about this issue working for a company that takes ownership of the issue makes a huge difference. Even though we have a long way to go, the engineering team at Good Eggs cares about taking steps in the right direction. Partnering with <a href='http://code2040.org/'>CODE2040</a>, having brainstorming sessions on how to increase diversity in the team, and having a forum in which to share ideas regarding diversity in tech are all examples of ways in which we are doing this. I am really proud to be part of a team in which it is not only acceptable, but it is productive to talk about making our team more diverse.</p>
<p>Being an intern at Good Eggs has been an amazing experience. I have learned as much about engineering process as I have about web development. I have worked on many different parts of the codebase with a lot of different developers. I have been shipping code since the first week. I have been part of a great team of genuinely nice people. And if that wasn’t enough, I have been able to add value to a product, see it grow, and do impactful work while learning a lot. </p>
