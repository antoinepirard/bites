<blockquote>
&quot;great first event for a meetup with a compelling mix of javascript code and social impact&quot;
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&quot;Great meetup! Lots of interesting people and talks. Looking forward to future ones.&quot;
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&quot;This was a great way to kickoff the Cultivate meetups; I left informed, enthused, (oh yeah, and nourished) and committed to return.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>Over 80 members of the developer community came together on a chilly San Francisco night, under a common purpose: to use technology for the betterment of humanity and the planet.</p>
<p>As Good Eggs CTO Alon Salant said in an opening statement, &quot;We are building tools that affect real people in the real world. It&#39;s about affecting real change in someone&#39;s work to enhance their life.&quot;</p>
<p>The event kicked off with with a delicious bang: <a href="http://www.goodeggs.com/loveandhummus">Love &amp; Hummus</a> delivered an exceptional dining experience. Hearty falafel wraps, homemade tahini sauce, spicy hummus, sultry baklava, and mint-garnish lemonade.</p>
<p>If your mouth isn&#39;t watering yet, wait till you sink your teeth into the presentations..</p>

<h2>Hanging up on Callbacks - [More than] Flow Control w/ECMAScript 6 Generators</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.carbonfive.com/employee/erin-swenson-healey">Erin Swanson-Healey</a> from Carbon Five gave a thorough walk-through into dealing with asynchronous callbacks in Javascript. With charisma and charm he  stated that we have new ways to deal with &quot;callback hell&quot;.</p>
<p>New Solution: <a href="http://www.2ality.com/2013/06/iterators-generators.html">ECMAScript 6</a> provides generators, which alleviates some of challenges that are associated with asynchronous callbacks.</p>
<p>Read Erin&#39;s <a href="http://blog.carbonfive.com/2013/12/01/hanging-up-on-callbacks-generators-in-ecmascript-6/">detailed blog post</a> on the topic, and check out his <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/goodeggs.com/presentation/d/1c23KjxQIoKKjho2wnjRXdJhmWd6X3g10B5ggC1DUE0M/edit#slide=id.p">slides</a> from the presentation here.</p>
<h2>Whats new in Node v0.12.</h2>
<p>Next up was <a href="https://github.com/piscisaureus">Bert Belder</a> from StrongLoop. Bert is one of the principal authors of <a href="http://nikhilm.github.io/uvbook/introduction.html">libuv</a>, which is the library on which Node.js is built. Needless to say, we were stoked to see him present at the first Cultivate meetup!</p>
<p>Bert provided insight into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Round-robin clustering</li>
<li>Profiling</li>
<li>ExecSync</li>
<li>Multi-context</li>
</ul>

<h2>MongoDB Performance Fundamentals for Web Apps</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.goodeggs.com/about/team/sfbay/522103184f08c30300000028">Adam Hull</a> from Good Eggs was our final presenter, and he finished strong! We were lucky to have insights from Adam into performance, speed, and use of Mongo. The presentation ended with a pretty long Q&amp;A session that surfaced  answers to some questions that the collective developer community seemed to have been yearning to ask. Many of the remarks were confirmed with a head-nod from two developers from MongoLab in the audience. Head nods and &quot;ah ha&#39;s&quot; all around!</p>
<h2>Lightning Talks</h2>
<p>Flashing through in 5-minute intervals, our speedy speakers were able to capture the audience with cool projects and insights, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jessica Lam - <a href="http://www.sgrbx.io/#/play/sHMVrO1jg8">real-time collaboration with sugarbox.io</a></li>
<li>Max Edmands - <a href="http://danieltao.com/lazy.js/">lazy.js</a> + <a href="https://github.com/demands/lazy-presentation">slides</a></li>
<li>Stewart Noyce - <a href="http://www.trunort.com/docs/Cultivate-Dec2013.pdf">lessons learned</a></li>
<li>Shubhra Kar - <a href="http://strongloop.com/strongloop-suite/strongops/">StrongOps Node performance monitoring dashboard</a></li>
<li>Alon Salant, - <a href="https://github.com/goodeggs/fibrous">fibrous library</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, from our speakers there is one common thread: writing great apps with JavaScript is hard work. But with new tools, techniques and frameworks emerging, we can &quot;cultivate&quot; the developer community into a unified force, working together to blend technology and awareness to benefit humankind, the planet, and our future.</p>
