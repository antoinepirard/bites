<p>So there we were, putting the polishing touches on our mobile app.  There were a few big bugs that we wanted to clean up before we launched.  One seemed a bit edge-case-y, but still not good: when iPhone users clicked on products and then subsequently clicked back to the product listings, they saw our animated spinner stuck like this:</p>

Have you written them down?</p>
<p>Lots of people think they have clear criteria for hiring but have never taken the time to write them down. Written criteria are an important component of an effective hiring process. In this post I&#39;ll share some guidance on establishing clear criteria, how to use them to design an efficient interview process, and the role they play in developing diversity on your team.</p>
<h2 id="defining-your-hiring-criteria">Defining Your Hiring Criteria</h2>
<p>There are a number strategies you can use to get to your criteria. If you haven&#39;t already you could probably just write them down right now and have something to work with. That&#39;s a fine start. Sharing them with your team for review and revision is likely to make them even better.</p>
<p>Another approach is to actively engage your team in developing your criteria. You can get pretty far with this short exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather your team in a quiet room</li>
<li>Hand out stickies and sharpies</li>
<li>Give the team 3 minutes to write down the desirable attributes of members of your team, one attribute per sticky</li>
<li>Have each person put their stickies on a wall and form clusters of related items</li>
<li>Give every member of the team 4 votes to <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DotVoting.html">dot vote</a> their top attributes</li>
</ul>
<p>Do the items with the most votes look like your criteria? You hopefully have a mix of different criteria that cover technical skills, working style, personality traits, domain expertise and more.</p></div><footer><a class="more" rel="full-article" href="/posts/written-hiring-criteria/">Continue…</a></footer></article><article class="truncated"><header><h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/posts/rivets-for-mobile/">Rivets for Mobile Web</a></h1><p class="meta"><a href="/authors/adam_hull/">Adam Hull</a> on <time datetime="2014-04-25T19:00:00.000Z">April 25th, 2014</time></p></header><div class="entry-content"><div class="series">

<p>Before coding a phone-sized farmer&#39;s market, the Good Eggs team built
production sites using tools at both extremes of the javascript application
ecosystem:  Backbone for our desktop experience and Angular for our internal tools.
But neither felt quite right for our mobile site.</p>
<p>We had two priorities for our mobile toolchain:</div><footer><a class="more" rel="full-article" href="/posts/rivets-for-mobile/">Continue…</a></footer></article><article class="truncated"><header><h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/posts/good-eggs-goes-mobile/">Good Eggs Goes Mobile</a></h1><p class="meta"><a href="/authors/michael_kebbekus_and_adam_hull/">Michael Kebbekus and Adam Hull</a> on <time datetime="2014-04-11T19:00:00.000Z">April 11th, 2014</time></p></header><div class="entry-content"><div class="series">

<p>In the past 6 months, 25% of our traffic came from mobile devices, and those users faced a
daunting, near impossible shopping experience. In response, we launched a new
mobile version of <a href="https://www.goodeggs.com">goodeggs.com</a> two weeks ago with an
eye to simplify our major use case of filling your basket with products and
checking out. To create the mobile experience we considered three options:</p>
<ol>
<li>native mobile apps for iOS and Android</li>
<li>a responsive re-design of our existing website</li>
<li>building a mobile website from scratch</li>

<p>Let&#39;s spend a few hours hacking together to make the world a better place. Bring your project or your desire to help others with theirs. Open source and socially-minded projects are all welcome. If you want to give a short presentation or run a mini workshop we have the facilities and welcome your initiative.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll kick off with project intros and requests for help to connect hackers with the projects they are interested in.</p>
<p>Start at 6pm with some great local food and drink to help us all connect, kick off at 6:30pm and doors close at 10:00pm.
A few folks from Good Eggs with expertise in Node, Backbone, Angular, MongoDB and more will be around to help and with some projects of their own.</p>

When you write a module, what options do you have for designing its interface?</p>
<p>When I was first learning to work in Node I found the sheer number of ways to do things to be a bit overwhelming. JavaScript is extremely flexible and the community of developers contributing to open source seem to have different styles for implementing the same thing.</p>
<p>On my journey with Node I&#39;ve been keeping an eye out the Good Way to do things and adopting them for use in my own work and in our work at Good Eggs.</p>
<p>In this post I&#39;ll share my observations of the Node module system and the ways in which you can use it to encapsulate and share code. My goal is to identify and illustrate useful patterns for module interface design and to help you understand when and how to use them in your own work.</p>
<p>I discuss seven patterns below, many of which can be used in combination. They are:</p>

Impossible</a></h1><p class="meta"><a href="/authors/adam_hull/">Adam Hull</a> on <time datetime="2013-08-17T19:00:00.000Z">August 17th, 2013</time></p></header><div class="entry-content"><p>A good Friday afternoon chat about asynchronous programming models left me wondering if the fibrous API could be implemented on top of <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:generators">ES6 generators</a>. Generators are baked in to Node 0.11, Chrome 19, and Firefox.  A port would be a big boost to interoperability.  <a href="https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler">Traceur</a> can even transform generator based code into a <a href="http://traceur-compiler.googlecode.com/git/demo/repl.html#function*%20test%20()%20%7B%0A%20%20yield%201%3B%0A%20%20var%20a%20%3D%20yield%202%3B%0A%20%20try%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20yield%20a%3B%0A%20%20%7D%20catch%20(e)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20yield%2099%3B%0A%20%20%7D%0A%20%20for(var%20i%20%3D0%3B%20i%20%3C%201%3B%20i%2B%2B)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20yield%20123%3B%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D%0A%0Afunction%20normal()%20%7B%0A%20%20var%20a%20%3D%20b%3B%0A%20%20return%20b%3B%0A%7D">giant state machine</a> that runs on all of today&#39;s environments.</p>
<p>At first the port looked promising. Wikipedia claimed that general coroutines could be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine#Comparison_with_generators">built on generators</a>, and many folks have <a href="http://taskjs.org/">done</a> <a href="https://gist.github.com/creationix/5762837">just</a> <a href="https://gist.github.com/Benvie/5667557">that</a>.  After a little noodling I&#39;m pretty sure it can&#39;t be done.  In a Harmony environment a function can only suspend execution at <code>yield</code> expressions and <code>yield</code> expressions can only appear in generator functions. A yield expression cannot be wrapped up behind a fibrous <code>sync</code> or <code>wait</code>.</p></div><footer><a class="more" rel="full-article" href="/posts/fibrous-on-harmony-generators/">Continue…</a></footer></article><div class="pagination"><a class="prev" href="/posts/3/">← Older</a><a class="next" href="/">→ Newer</a></div></div></div></div><footer><div class="mission">Our mission is to grow and sustain local food systems worldwide.</div><p>©2013 Good Eggs, Inc</p></footer></body></html>
