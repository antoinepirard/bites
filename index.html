<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>
<p>One concept in particular stood out for me. It was the idea that you can&#39;t actually design all touch points of the customer experience across a service that spans the physical and digital realms and where much of the actual service is provided by a third party. Rather, identify and nurture a set of core values across all members of your team, your customers and your service providers and allow them to manifest those values in ways that are natural to them. Through this you will find behaviors emerging out in the wild that are consistent with those core values and result in a remarkably consistent experience for all involved.</p>
<p>For Airbnb a core value is that the host is the hero of the guest experience. For Good Eggs it is the mission to grow and sustain local food systems worldwide. For Lyft it is a quirky style that celebrates individualism.</p>
<p>What did you learn?</p>

What’s it look like? More to the point, what’s it sound like?</p>
<p>The Good Eggs foodhub in San Francisco, where the engineering team resides, isn’t the quietest place I’ve ever worked. Every morning, there’s local farmers wheeling in crate after crate of watermelons and tomatoes and so much more. There’s the sound of our operations team working to get all that food into the right bins and later into the right cars, delivering people good, local food, grown with integrity. There’s the chatter of the daily standup meetings that spring up all around the foodhub throughout the morning as each team gears up for the day.</p>
<p>Is all that action distracting? Not for me! I absolutely love it. When I wake up every morning, I can’t imagine a better, more exciting place to go work. Our foodhub isn’t a shrine to silent contemplation. And it shouldn’t be. It’s a living, breathing part of the new food economy that we’re helping to build.</p>
<p>There are two things in particular that I love about coding in the foodhub.</p>
<h2 id="rapid-feedback">Rapid Feedback</h2>
<p>Last week, we on the “operations tools” team built some new features to use barcodes and scanners to make it easier to keep track of the food we receive at the foodhub every morning. Tuesday afternoon, we pushed the code to production. Wednesday morning, the receiving lead in San Francisco, Zach, used the new tools to check in that day’s food as it arrived. Some features worked well, and some didn’t, so he walked the twenty yards over to our cluster of desks and told us about it. Wednesday afternoon, we pushed some updates. Thursday morning, Zach used it again and gave us his stamp of approval.</p>
<p>It’s easy to talk about the value of rapid prototyping. I think it’s tough to imagine really making it happen without the easy communication that our foodhub creates.</p>
<h2 id="task-significance-finding-meaning-in-work">Task Significance: Finding Meaning in Work</h2>
<p>What makes for good work? People point to many different things: interesting challenges. Room for creativity. <a href="https://www.goodeggs.com/about/team/sfbay">Great teammates</a>. Constant learning and growth. I’ve found all of those in abundance at Good Eggs.</p>
<p>But most of all, I’ve found meaning in my work here. Theorists of work describe <a href="http://imondrow.blogspot.com/2010/12/significance-of-task-significance.html">“task significance”</a> as the perception that one&#39;s job has a positive impact on other people. Not surprisingly, task significance is strongly correlated with <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/93/1/108/">higher performance</a> and <a href="http://rop.sagepub.com/content/24/1/18.full.pdf">satisfaction</a> at work.</p>
<p>Task significance is easy to come by at Good Eggs. Every day, the foodhub reminds me of why I’m working here. I’m working to support the farmer who shows up at our foodhub twice a week, selling locally, organically grown produce. I&#39;m working to support our awesome, skilled operations team as they lovingly sort through produce, carefully pack bags, and efficiently deliver food to our waiting customers. I&#39;m working to support the people who will soon receive their orders, so that they can eat delicious, healthy meals while participating in a thriving local economy.</p>
<p>Task significance? Heck yes.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, German philosopher <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schopenhauer/">Arthur Schopenhauer</a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/369017-i-have-long-held-the-opinion-that-the-amount-of">wrote</a>, &quot;I have long held the opinion that the amount of noise that anyone can bear undisturbed stands in inverse proportion to his mental capacity and therefore be regarded as a pretty fair measure of it.&quot;</p>
<p>With all due respect, Arthur, I disagree. If the noise in question is the sound of a local, ethical, friendly food economy growing and thriving, then I want to work right in the middle of it.</p>
<p>What makes a good workplace for you? Let us know!</p>

<p>Recent years have seen the rise of companies that serve well-established needs in people’s lives with novel supply chains built on the resources and hard work of individuals rather than faceless corporations.</p>
<p>Airbnb provides travel accommodation by aggregating rooms, apartments and houses from individuals around the world. Good Eggs provides home groceries by aggregating food available directly from local farmers and foodmakers. Lyft provides daily transportation by connecting passengers to people with cars and spare time.</p>
<p>Travel accommodation, groceries and transportation are age-old needs. These companies are serving them in new ways with hybrid online/offline services that build on the ubiquity of internet technology to organize complex supply systems into simple-to-use services for their customers.</p>
<p>How do you design and deploy a brand across digital and physical experiences? How do you provide a consistent customer experience when much of the product experience is provided by a third party?</p>
<p>Join us for a conversation on the challenges, learnings and opportunities in designing for these kinds of services.</p>
<p>This event is a panel discussion with leaders in design from Airbnb, Good Eggs and Lyft.</p>
<p>Katie Dill, <em>Experience Design Lead, Airbnb</em><br/>
Robin Bigio, <em>Creative Director, Good Eggs</em><br/>
Frank Yoo, <em>Director of Product Design, Lyft</em><br/></p>
<p>Moderated by Patrice Martin, <em>Co-Lead + Creative Director, IDEO.org</em></p>
<p>Doors open at 6:30pm for great nourishing local snacks and drink from Good Eggs producers. Panel discussion starts at 7:30pm. Doors close at 9:30pm.</p>

That wasn&#39;t exactly my intention. As a teenager I sketched out user interfaces in my room and dreamed of working at Pixar or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000510065138/http://www.aliaswavefront.com/pages/home/index.html">Alias|Wavefront</a>. But I guess my most exciting opportunties were always hourly gigs, contracting jobs, grad school, and&mdash;most recently&mdash;founding a startup.</p>
<p>I like design and development because they are super creative, but I can&#39;t resist applying that creativity to management philosophies, corporate structures, and every other aspect of a business. That can make it hard to work for other people, who will inevitably have different ideas about how things should work.</p>
<p>Founding a startup is an alluring alternative. There&#39;s no technical debt to work around. There are no power structures you have to reckon with. You can call shots all day without worrying much about stepping on other peoples&#39; toes. You make compromises and code up ugly hacks, but they&#39;re <em>your</em> compromises and <em>your</em> ugly hacks.</p>
<p>It&#39;s addictive.</p>

<p>Starting javascript on DOMContentLoaded, a pattern <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/bootstrap">baked into</a> or <a href="http://backbonejs.org/docs/todos.html#section-2">recommended by</a> many frameworks, defers some work that could be done earlier.  There aren&#39;t many examples of what can be done early, or how to wire it up.  Here&#39;s how we did it on the Good Eggs mobile site.

<p>So there we were, putting the polishing touches on our mobile app.  There were a few big bugs that we wanted to clean up before we launched.  One seemed a bit edge-case-y, but still not good: when iPhone users clicked on products and then subsequently clicked back to the product listings, they saw our animated spinner stuck like this:</p>

Have you written them down?</p>
<p>Lots of people think they have clear criteria for hiring but have never taken the time to write them down. Written criteria are an important component of an effective hiring process. In this post I&#39;ll share some guidance on establishing clear criteria, how to use them to design an efficient interview process, and the role they play in developing diversity on your team.</p>
<h2 id="defining-your-hiring-criteria">Defining Your Hiring Criteria</h2>
<p>There are a number strategies you can use to get to your criteria. If you haven&#39;t already you could probably just write them down right now and have something to work with. That&#39;s a fine start. Sharing them with your team for review and revision is likely to make them even better.</p>
<p>Another approach is to actively engage your team in developing your criteria. You can get pretty far with this short exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather your team in a quiet room</li>
<li>Hand out stickies and sharpies</li>
<li>Give the team 3 minutes to write down the desirable attributes of members of your team, one attribute per sticky</li>
<li>Have each person put their stickies on a wall and form clusters of related items</li>
<li>Give every member of the team 4 votes to <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DotVoting.html">dot vote</a> their top attributes</li>
</ul>
<p>Do the items with the most votes look like your criteria? You hopefully have a mix of different criteria that cover technical skills, working style, personality traits, domain expertise and more.</p>

<p>Before coding a phone-sized farmer&#39;s market, the Good Eggs team built
production sites using tools at both extremes of the javascript application
ecosystem:  Backbone for our desktop experience and Angular for our internal tools.
But neither felt quite right for our mobile site.</p>
<p>We had two priorities for our mobile toolchain: </div><footer><a rel="full-article" href="./posts/rivets-for-mobile/">Continue…</a></footer></article><article><header><h1 class="entry-title"><a href="./posts/good-eggs-goes-mobile/">Good Eggs Goes Mobile</a></h1><p class="meta"><a href="./authors/michael_kebbekus_and_adam_hull/">Michael Kebbekus and Adam Hull</a> on <time datetime="2014-04-11T00:00:00.000Z">April 11th, 2014</time></p></header><div class="entry-content"><div class="series">

<p>In the past 6 months, 25% of our traffic came from mobile devices, and those users faced a
daunting, near impossible shopping experience. In response, we launched a new
mobile version of <a href="https://www.goodeggs.com">goodeggs.com</a> two weeks ago with an
eye to simplify our major use case of filling your basket with products and
checking out. To create the mobile experience we considered three options:</p>
<ol>
<li>native mobile apps for iOS and Android</li>
<li>a responsive re-design of our existing website</li>
<li>building a mobile website from scratch</li>
