This summer I am working as a Software Engineering Intern at Good Eggs. A typical conversation when meeting or running into other interns in the area usually goes something like this: </p>
<p>-Hey! What are you doing this summer? <br>
-Interning at Good Eggs, working on the Shopping Team. <br>
-Cool, what are you working on? <br>
-I&#39;m doing full stack web dev. <br>
-Yeah, but what’s your project? <br>
-Emm, the website...<br></p>
<p>Given that a lot of interns have an intern project, this conversation can be a little awkward sometimes. Questions like How do you get evaluated? and How do you know what to do? often come up, and to be completely honest I have been looking for answers to these questions myself during the summer. </p>
<p>So far this is what I&#39;ve got...</p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>
<p>One concept in particular stood out for me. It was the idea that you can&#39;t actually design all touch points of the customer experience across a service that spans the physical and digital realms and where much of the actual service is provided by a third party. Rather, identify and nurture a set of core values across all members of your team, your customers and your service providers and allow them to manifest those values in ways that are natural to them. Through this you will find behaviors emerging out in the wild that are consistent with those core values and result in a remarkably consistent experience for all involved.</p>
<p>For Airbnb a core value is that the host is the hero of the guest experience. For Good Eggs it is the mission to grow and sustain local food systems worldwide. For Lyft it is a quirky style that celebrates individualism.</p>
<p>What did you learn?</p>

What’s it look like? More to the point, what’s it sound like?</p>
<p>The Good Eggs foodhub in San Francisco, where the engineering team resides, isn’t the quietest place I’ve ever worked. Every morning, there’s local farmers wheeling in crate after crate of watermelons and tomatoes and so much more. There’s the sound of our operations team working to get all that food into the right bins and later into the right cars, delivering people good, local food, grown with integrity. There’s the chatter of the daily standup meetings that spring up all around the foodhub throughout the morning as each team gears up for the day.</p>
<p>Is all that action distracting? Not for me! I absolutely love it. When I wake up every morning, I can’t imagine a better, more exciting place to go work. Our foodhub isn’t a shrine to silent contemplation. And it shouldn’t be. It’s a living, breathing part of the new food economy that we’re helping to build.</p>
<p>There are two things in particular that I love about coding in the foodhub.</p>

<p>Recent years have seen the rise of companies that serve well-established needs in people’s lives with novel supply chains built on the resources and hard work of individuals rather than faceless corporations.</p>
<p>Airbnb provides travel accommodation by aggregating rooms, apartments and houses from individuals around the world. Good Eggs provides home groceries by aggregating food available directly from local farmers and foodmakers. Lyft provides daily transportation by connecting passengers to people with cars and spare time.</p>
<p>Travel accommodation, groceries and transportation are age-old needs. These companies are serving them in new ways with hybrid online/offline services that build on the ubiquity of internet technology to organize complex supply systems into simple-to-use services for their customers.</p>
<p>How do you design and deploy a brand across digital and physical experiences? How do you provide a consistent customer experience when much of the product experience is provided by a third party?</p>
<p>Join us for a conversation on the challenges, learnings and opportunities in designing for these kinds of services.</p>
<p>This event is a panel discussion with leaders in design from Airbnb, Good Eggs and Lyft.</p>
<p>Katie Dill, <em>Experience Design Lead, Airbnb</em><br/>
Robin Bigio, <em>Creative Director, Good Eggs</em><br/>
Frank Yoo, <em>Director of Product Design, Lyft</em><br/></p>
<p>Moderated by Patrice Martin, <em>Co-Lead + Creative Director, IDEO.org</em></p>
<p>Doors open at 6:30pm for great nourishing local snacks and drink from Good Eggs producers. Panel discussion starts at 7:30pm. Doors close at 9:30pm.</p>

That wasn&#39;t exactly my intention. As a teenager I sketched out user interfaces in my room and dreamed of working at Pixar or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000510065138/http://www.aliaswavefront.com/pages/home/index.html">Alias|Wavefront</a>. But I guess my most exciting opportunties were always hourly gigs, contracting jobs, grad school, and&mdash;most recently&mdash;founding a startup.</p>
<p>I like design and development because they are super creative, but I can&#39;t resist applying that creativity to management philosophies, corporate structures, and every other aspect of a business. That can make it hard to work for other people, who will inevitably have different ideas about how things should work.</p>
<p>Founding a startup is an alluring alternative. There&#39;s no technical debt to work around. There are no power structures you have to reckon with. You can call shots all day without worrying much about stepping on other peoples&#39; toes. You make compromises and code up ugly hacks, but they&#39;re <em>your</em> compromises and <em>your</em> ugly hacks.</p>
<p>It&#39;s addictive.</p>

<p>Starting javascript on DOMContentLoaded, a pattern <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/bootstrap">baked into</a> or <a href="http://backbonejs.org/docs/todos.html#section-2">recommended by</a> many frameworks, defers some work that could be done earlier.  There aren&#39;t many examples of what can be done early, or how to wire it up.  Here&#39;s how we did it on the Good Eggs mobile site.

<p>Handling errors in asynchronous flow is pretty straightforward and easy. Handling errors in asynchronous flow in a clean and easy to follow manner - not so much.</p>

<p>So there we were, putting the polishing touches on our mobile app.  There were a few big bugs that we wanted to clean up before we launched.  One seemed a bit edge-case-y, but still not good: when iPhone users clicked on products and then subsequently clicked back to the product listings, they saw our animated spinner stuck like this:</p>

Have you written them down?</p>
<p>Lots of people think they have clear criteria for hiring but have never taken the time to write them down. Written criteria are an important component of an effective hiring process. In this post I&#39;ll share some guidance on establishing clear criteria, how to use them to design an efficient interview process, and the role they play in developing diversity on your team.</p>
<h2 id="defining-your-hiring-criteria">Defining Your Hiring Criteria</h2>
<p>There are a number strategies you can use to get to your criteria. If you haven&#39;t already you could probably just write them down right now and have something to work with. That&#39;s a fine start. Sharing them with your team for review and revision is likely to make them even better.</p>
<p>Another approach is to actively engage your team in developing your criteria. You can get pretty far with this short exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather your team in a quiet room</li>
<li>Hand out stickies and sharpies</li>
<li>Give the team 3 minutes to write down the desirable attributes of members of your team, one attribute per sticky</li>
<li>Have each person put their stickies on a wall and form clusters of related items</li>
<li>Give every member of the team 4 votes to <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DotVoting.html">dot vote</a> their top attributes</li>
</ul>
<p>Do the items with the most votes look like your criteria? You hopefully have a mix of different criteria that cover technical skills, working style, personality traits, domain expertise and more.</p>

<p>Before coding a phone-sized farmer&#39;s market, the Good Eggs team built
production sites using tools at both extremes of the javascript application
ecosystem:  Backbone for our desktop experience and Angular for our internal tools.
But neither felt quite right for our mobile site.</p>
<p>We had two priorities for our mobile toolchain: </div><footer><a rel="full-article" href="./posts/rivets-for-mobile/">Continue…</a></footer></article><div class="pagination"><a class="prev" href="./index.1">← Older</a></div></div></div></div><footer><div class="mission">Our mission is to grow and sustain local food systems worldwide.</div><p>©2013 Good Eggs, Inc</p></footer></body></html>
